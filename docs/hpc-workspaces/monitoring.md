# HPC Workspace Monitoring Tools

## Description
The Workspace monitoring tools provide access to status information for HPC workspaces: quota, and Slurm fair share priorities.

## Quota tool
The quota tool provides an storage overview of your HOME and all workspaces you are belonging to. 

As an example:
```
$ quota
```

Additional information can be requested using the `-l` (`--long`) option:
```
$ quota -l
```
