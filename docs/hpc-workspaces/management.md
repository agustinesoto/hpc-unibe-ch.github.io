# Workspace management

## Description

## Guideline

## Prerequisite
Each Workspace belongs to a research group. Therefore the research group first need to be registered, which can be requested on the Service Portal:

[//]: # (TODO provide link to the ServicePortal)

## Application
A workspace can be requested by a research group lead

[//]: # (TODO provide link to the ServicePortal)

## Responsibility
The research group lead will be the the workspace owner and therewith the responsible person especially for purchased extensions. 
Additionally, a deputy can be defined, who can also manage the workspace

## Modification
Responsible for a HPC project is a research group leader, who needs to apply for the project. Members could be research group members or any other combination of UniBE campus accounts. Project management responsibilities can be delegated to a person defined in the project application form, this includes:

- adding new members to primary or secondary group
- storage extension
- project live time extension

The project can be modified by the project owner (research group lead) and the specified deputy using the form on the porta:

[//]: # (TODO provide link to the ServicePortal)



### Availablity
We want to prevent dead, hanging workspaces. Therefore, a workspace has a default live time of one year. A notification will be send before the project expires. An extension can be requested any time for another year with few clicks in the service portal:

[//]: # (TODO what is the data live time)
[//]: # (TODO provide link to the ServicePortal)
