# Description
This page provides a high-level system overview of UBELIX. It describes
the different hardware components that constitute the cluster and gives
a quantitative list of the different generations of compute nodes in UBELIX.

*UBELIX* (Acronym for *U*niversity of *Be*rn *Li*nu*x* Cluster) is a HPC
cluster that currently consists of about 330 compute nodes featuring almost
6'300 CPU cores and 300'000 GPU cores and a software-defined storage infrastructure
providing ~580 TB of disk storage net. UBELIX is a heterogeneous cluster,
meaning UBELIX consists of different generations of compute nodes with different 
instruction sets. Compute nodes, front-end servers and the storage are
interconnected through a high speed Infiniband network. The front-end servers
also provide a link to the outside world. UBELIX is used by various institutes
and research groups within chemistry, biology, physics, astronomy, computer
science, geography, medical radiology and others for scientific research and by
students working on their thesis.
